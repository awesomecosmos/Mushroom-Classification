# Mushroom Classification
 
This is a fun project to apply the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process and numerous classification algorithms on the [Mushrooms dataset, available from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification?datasetId=478&sortBy=voteCount), which consists of 8143 data observations of mushrooms and 23 features that describe two classes of mushrooms - edible, and poisonous.

## Introduction

I love going out for walks in nature. Often in the parks and forested areas I wander during these walks, I come across mushrooms growing here and there (which are fun to squish sometimes tbh). I have noticed these mushrooms come in a variety of shapes and sizes, and that made me wonder about them. Natuarally as a data scientist, I headed online to see if I could find a dataset on mushrooms that I could analyze. This project is the resulting breakdown of analyzing what (in general) makes mushrooms poisonous vs edible. Read on for more info!

## Data Source

I found a [mushrooms dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification?datasetId=478&sortBy=voteCount), which consists of 8143 records of mushrooms, broken down by 23 characteristics that describe the mushrooms, and their classification (either 'e'=edible, or 'p'=poisonous). This turned out to be a remarkably clean dataset, interestingly enough! Here is some more information about the dataset, taken directly from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification?datasetId=478&sortBy=voteCount):

> This dataset includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom drawn from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one. The Guide clearly states that there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom; no rule like "leaflets three, let it be'' for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.

> Time period: Donated to UCI ML 27 April 1987

## Analysis Methods

Given that the mushrooms in the dataset are either classified as 'edible' or 'poisonous', this indicates this is a binary classification problem. Therefore, I have structured my analysis in two main parts:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Predicting classifications of mushrooms

## Algorithms

In order to predict the binary classifications, I used a range of algorithms, and chose the best algorithm (discussed later). Here are the algorithms I used:
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree
- Logistic Regression
- SVC (Support Vector Classification)
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- XGBoost
